There is a KING size bed in the room now but the room size makes it seem small.
The room is 12' x 10'4" - very large for the east village.

Floor plan shows how big this apartment is compared to the normal east village apartments.
It's also very modern with fast elevators, laundry and a dishwasher.

There's a perfect nook area separated from the living room which can fit a 5' desk

I just moved in so the rest of the apartment is in process of being furnished.
